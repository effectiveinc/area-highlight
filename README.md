## About Area Highlight
A small script built by Andrei Sierkov that parses a web-page for image maps and appends highlights to indicate where they are. Thier visibility is toggled by the "space bar" or other clicks on the image. This script is to be used with HTML that has already been generated from some other means (like Dreamweaver or Omnigraffle)

## How to use
Place a folder called “area-highlight” into the same location as your html files. This folder should contain area-highlight.js and area-highlight.css.

Place these two lines of code into each of your HTML files.
```<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="area-highlight/area-highlight.css">```
```<script src="area-highlight/area-highlight.js" type="text/javascript"></script>```
